# Online Business Card
Play around with Greensock and 3D transformations.

Issues remaining:
- Sometimes when spinning to the back of the card, the bottom of the card doesn't pop out to the user as expected. Chaining of events needed.
- When screen size change, vertical adjustment doesn't occur.  
- Peculiar mouse move angle bug in Edge, rotates far beyond the values calculated. Although soon won't be an issue as they release the Chromium version.
- Internet Explorer 11 doesn't work at all, needs logo display fallback - and prompt to upgrade!

*Note: This is really just a playground, lots of brushing up of calculations and widths required, as well as full refactor / splitting out of code.*
